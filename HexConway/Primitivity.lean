Tier 2: primitivity of the committed Conway entries.

A Conway polynomial is required to be *primitive*: the residue of `x` in
`F_p[x] / (C(p, n))` must generate the multiplicative group, so its order is
exactly `N = p^n - 1` rather than a proper divisor.

# Why this is checkable

Order `N` is established by the standard test: `α ^ N = 1`, and
`α ^ (N / q) ≠ 1` for every prime `q` dividing `N`. Both halves are needed —
the first alone only says the order divides `N`.

The exponents are large (`4826808` at `(13, 6)`), so they are not replayed by
repeated multiplication. Writing the exponent in base `p` and running Horner
costs `n` steps, each one `p` squarings-by-multiplication plus at most `p - 1`
more, so a whole check is a few hundred modular multiplications instead of
millions. Everything below is structurally recursive because the kernel has to
run it; `GFqField.pow` is square-and-multiply over well-founded recursion and
does not reduce.

# What the check establishes, and what it does not

`primitiveCheck` validates all of its supplied data before using it: that the
primes really are prime, that their product with the multiplicities really is
`p^n - 1`, and that each digit list really decodes to the exponent it is meant
to be. Only then does it run the two power conditions.

The product test is what makes the prime list trustworthy, and it is worth
saying why. If the supplied `q_i` are prime and `∏ q_i ^ e_i = N`, then by
unique factorization the `q_i` are *exactly* the prime divisors of `N` — there
is no room for a missing one. So checking `α ^ (N / q) ≠ 1` across the supplied
list really does cover every prime divisor, and a caller cannot weaken the test
by handing it a short list: the product would come out wrong.

Given all of it, the multiplicative order of `α` is `N`. The transport that
states this in Mathlib's terms is in `HexGFqMathlib.Primitivity`, which carries
these structural powers to Mathlib powers along `ofPolyHom` and supplies the
exhaustiveness of the prime list.

What this file provides is the verified computational content, for all
thirty-seven committed entries with `p^n > 2`.

/--
The Tier 2 primitivity check for a committed entry.

`fullDigits` is `p^n - 1` in base `p`, most significant first, and
`perPrimeDigits` holds `(p^n - 1) / q` in the same form, in the same order as
`qs`; `es` carries the multiplicities.

Every piece of supplied data is validated before it is used, except the
primality of `qs`, which is carried as a hypothesis by
`Primitive` instead. Deciding primality inline does not scale:
the divisors of `p^n - 1` reach five digits, and the linear instance is far too
slow there — `Hex.Nat.prime_of_bounded` is what those proofs use. Given
primality, the product check forces `qs` to be *all* the prime divisors, by
unique factorization. The digit lists are checked to decode to `p^n - 1` and to each
`(p^n - 1) / q`, so a caller cannot pass exponents that are easy to satisfy.
Only then are the two power conditions run.
