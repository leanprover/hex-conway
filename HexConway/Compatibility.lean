Tier 2: compatibility of the committed Conway entries across the subfield
lattice.

Tier 1 proves each committed entry monic, irreducible, and of the requested
degree. That makes `F_p[x] / (C(p, n))` a field of order `p ^ n`, but it says
nothing that distinguishes `C(p, n)` from any other irreducible of the same
degree. The property that does is compatibility: writing `α` for the residue of
`x`, whenever `m ∣ n` the norm

```
N(α) = α ^ ((p^n - 1) / (p^m - 1))
```

is a root of `C(p, m)`. That is what makes the subfield of order `p ^ m` inside
`F_p[x] / (C(p, n))` *the* canonical one, and it is what a subfield embedding
`GFq p m → GFq p n` is built from.

# Why this is cheap to check

The exponent is enormous — for `(p, m, n) = (13, 1, 6)` it is `402234` — so a
direct modular exponentiation is not something the kernel should be asked to
replay. It does not have to be. Setting `k = n / m`,

```
(p^n - 1) / (p^m - 1) = 1 + p^m + p^(2m) + ... + p^((k-1)m)
```

so

```
N(α) = α · α^(p^m) · α^(p^(2m)) · ... · α^(p^((k-1)m))
```

and `α ↦ α^p` is the Frobenius, which on residues is composition with
`x^p mod C(p, n)`. So the whole computation is `n` modular compositions and `k`
modular multiplications, with `n ≤ 8` and `k ≤ 8`, rather than a modular
exponentiation with a six-digit exponent. Everything below is structurally
recursive for the same reason: the kernel has to run it.

# What is proved

The norm and geometric-exponent identities in the first two displays are
theorems below. The reusable bridges are
`FpPoly.Quotient.reduce_powModMonicLinear_eq_pow`, which identifies the
structural modular power in the quotient, and
`FpPoly.Quotient.Internal.eval_X_eq_reduce`, which says evaluation at the class
of `x` is quotient reduction. Together with
`FpPoly.Quotient.Internal.eval_pow_prime`, they show that every modular
composition in `frobeniusIter` is a Frobenius step.

Consequently `normX_eq_pow` identifies the computed norm representative with
the geometric-sum power in any quotient, and `subfieldGen_eq_norm` rewrites
that exponent as `(p^n - 1) / (p^m - 1)` for `0 < m` and `m ∣ n`.

Compatibility of two committed Conway entries across the subfield lattice.

`Compatible p m n` says that the residue of `x` in `F_p[x] / (C(p, n))`, raised

{name}`Hex.Conway.compatCheck`, which computes that power as a product of
Frobenius images rather than as a modular exponentiation, so the statement is
`decide`-able for the committed entries.

The hypothesis `m ∣ n` is carried rather than derived: the quotient `n / m` is
what the check recurses on, and outside the divisor case it would not be the
right number of factors.

/-! # Towards the subfield embedding

Compatibility is what an embedding `F_p[x]/(C(p, m)) → F_p[x]/(C(p, n))` is
built from: send the generator to {name}`Hex.Conway.subfieldGen`, which the
theorem above shows is a root of `C(p, m)`, and substitute.

That map is *not* defined here. Substitution is well defined on residues only
if congruent representatives evaluate equally, and for `c - c' = q * C(p, m)`
that needs the substitution map to be multiplicative. Defining it without that
would be defining something whose defining property is unproved.

The remaining work is smaller than it looks, and it is not a Mathlib-free
problem. `→+*` is a Mathlib notion, so the embedding belongs in
hex-gfq-mathlib, and there multiplicativity comes for free:
`Polynomial.eval₂RingHom` is a ring homomorphism by construction, and
`Polynomial.induction_on'` reduces agreement with the executable substitution
to the additive and monomial cases. `Hex.FpPoly.compose_add` supplies the
first; `compose_C` and the monomial lemmas in `HexPolyFp.Compose` supply the
second. What is then left is the descent to residues, which is Hex's own
division identity plus the vanishing fact proved above.

Note in particular that no `compose_mul` is required: the induction principle
needs additivity only, and the multiplicative structure is Mathlib's.

/-! # The committed compatibility facts

One theorem for every committed pair `(p, m, n)` with `m ∣ n` and `m < n`:
fifty-two in all. Each is discharged by `decide`, which replays the norm
computation described above. The whole block costs a fraction of what the
Tier 1 irreducibility certificates cost, because no modular exponentiation is
involved.

/-! # The uniform statement

The fifty-two facts above are indexed by literal `(p, m, n)`. This is the form
the SPEC names: one theorem taking the divisibility hypothesis, dispatching on
the pair. Anything outside the committed table has no `SupportedEntry`, so the
hypothesis pair is what makes the match total.
-/

/--
Every committed pair of Conway entries whose degrees divide is compatible.

This is the SPEC's `conwayPoly_compat`. Given `m ∣ n` and committed entries at
both degrees, the norm of the generator of `F_p[x] / (C(p, n))` down to the
degree-`m` subfield is a root of `C(p, m)`. It is what distinguishes the
committed table from an arbitrary choice of irreducibles, and it is what
{name}`Hex.Conway.subfieldGen` is built on.

The proof dispatches on the literal degrees rather than arguing uniformly,
because the underlying facts are kernel computations over specific committed
polynomials, not instances of a general theorem. `m = n` is admitted and
handled separately: a field is its own degree-`n` subfield, and the norm is
then the empty product times the generator.
